FishLang
===================================  

FishLang based on bootstrap, emberjs and rails. <br />
It's a big trouble for most of poeple to remember the changes of Spanish verbs. <br />
So I decided to design one tool to practise the verbs change. <br />
It helps you increase the memory of Spanish words, especially the verbs change. <br />
